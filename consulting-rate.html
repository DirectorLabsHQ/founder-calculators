Minor Suggestions

Live Calculation

<input ... oninput="calculate()">


Gives instant feedback when the user types, improving interactivity.

Edge Cases

Billable hours = 0 could break the formula. You already have || 1, which is fine, but you could show a warning if hours are too low.

Visual Enhancements

Consider a subtle progress bar showing percentage of salary covered by current rate, similar to your churn calculator’s retained revenue bar. Gives instant visual feedback.

Professional Tone

Could change “Set Your Rate” to “Calculate Your Ideal Rate” — slightly more formal for consulting professionals.

Optional Advanced Feature

Add toggle for project-based rates: Hourly vs Project calculator for consultants who bill per project.

✅ Example small improvement for live calculation
<input type="number" id="targetSalary" value="150000" oninput="calculate()" class="w-full p-3 border rounded-lg focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 outline-none">


Just add oninput="calculate()" to the other inputs as well.
